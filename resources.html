                            <p><span>Investment</span> is a financial asset that is acquired with the aim of earning future income or achieving a profit by selling it at a higher price later. The main goal of investments is generating returns (ROI) and yielding better profits.</p>

                            <p><span>Insurance</span> acts as a financial safety net. This involves paying a company money (premiums) and in return they cover the costs for whatever loss or damage that qualifies under the policy that you accepted. This could help in assuring that your loved ones will be taken care of in case an injury or accident befell upon you, saving them from any sort of debt. Under that same notion are Life Insurance Retirement Plans (LIRPS) which are permanent life insurance policies that aim to build cash value, this may provide you with financial security upon your retirement.</p>
                            <p>How does a company cover all of that? By collecting premiums from their members (policyholders), the company can pay using the premiums collected from all policyholders so that the financial burden doesn't rest solely on one person.</p>

Here are three affordable and low-risk investment options that you can try as a student.</p>
