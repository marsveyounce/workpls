        <h1>What is Utang na Loob?</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <div class="description-paragraph">
                <p class="description-text">The term “utang na loob” is a word considered as a manner or ethic in the Philippines; It directly translates to “self-debt” or “internal-debt”. “Utang na loob” are actions where you must give back the act of kindness another person has given or done for you. Although it can be known as a virtuous trait among the Filipinos internationally, it also becomes an issue when over done.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="description-paragraph">
                <p class="description-text">“Utang ng Loob” is a by-product of the family household-centric mentality that Asian households have within their individual cultures. The problem is not parents relying on their children for their retirement plan, but rather the lack of awareness/foresight to have a retirement fund or a financial fallback that would allow them to finally rest from work.</p>

        <h1>The Effects of Utang na Loob</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <div class="description-paragraph">
                <p class="description-text">With “utang na loob” being so deeply ingrained within our culture, it undoubtedly affects us one way or another. Although it may serve the advantages of strengthening family ties and showing gratitude, it can also lead to exploitative and unhealthy tendencies with children being expected or pressured to continuously provide.</p>
                <p class="description-text">After interviewing Filipino adults aged 20-42 who are providing or expected to provide for their parents in retirement, the research team found that all of them experienced “utang na loob” one way or another. Although the scope of interviewees were on a much lower scale, the effects were still present nonetheless.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="description-paragraph">
                <p class="description-text">A good deal of the respondents expressed that they wanted to show their gratitude for all the sacrifices their parents had done but also noting the difficulties and struggles that came with doing so, especially with some of them being parents themselves and some having to provide for other members of the family. One respondent acknowledged the additional pressures she felt especially since her parents were also sick.</p>
                <p class="description-text">After asking the respondents if they themselves had any retirement plans, 7 out of 12 stated they did not with the majority of them already being parents.</p>
